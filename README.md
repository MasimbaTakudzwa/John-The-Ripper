This repository serves as a record for an investigation that was done into John the Ripper as part of my MSc Cyber Security and Data Analytics. There are 100 Passwords of varying complexity and python files that make hashing a number of passwords easier once the syntax for running the code is understood. Details regarding the syntax for the python code posted here will be released once
the paper this code was used in is submitted. The code in the file can be tweaked for the desired outcome. Please note all the items in this repository are under the Creative Commons License.
